# Analysis Tasks

## Running reports
Reports are listed under analytical tasks because they are a fundamental part of the analytical process, and have more to do with looking at data that is there, than with adding or modifying primary data. That said, you may be interested in running a report, even if you otherwise just do data collection.

## (Comprehensive) Alphabet Report
This report gives you information on Consonants and Vowels, according to the part of speech, syllable profile, and check you have asked for (e.g., CVCV Nouns by V1, or by V1=V2, or V1xV2 —the correspondence of the two vowels). The Comprehensive report gives you Nouns and Verbs, in the two largest syllable profiles, across all appropriate checks.

## (Comprehensive) Tone Report
This report gives you information on words in tone frames, according to the part of speech and syllable profile, organized with each framed example under its head word. The (by frames) report organizes the examples by frame, listing each word that has been sorted into that frame. The Comprehensive report gives you the top [two] parts of speech (should be Nouns and Verbs), in the [two] largest syllable profiles, across all appropriate checks (both of these numbers are configurable, if you want more or less of either).

## Transcribe Tone
In the sorting process, A→Z+T assigns numbers to the surface tone groups for each frame, because the first and main purpose is to distinguish what is different, and group what is the same. But here we can make those numbers more meaningful, assigning a phonetic value to the one tone melody shared by the group. This should be done in symbolic notation (e.g., {˦˦˦  ˨˨˨]), though you can use other notation as well. In any csae, this is **surface tone transcription**, not any kind of underlying representation, so and reference to High or Low tones is inapprpriate here.

## Join Underlying Form Groups
The UF groups drafted by A→Z+T are almost always clearly hypersplit. Here you can join those that (in your judgement) should be joined, and give them more meaningful names than the defaults (e.g., Noun_CVCV_1). These can by anything you want, including maintaining the part of speech and syllable profile info, and it is appropriate to add here your hypthesis about underlying forms.
These groups can be renamed as you like, and these names will be represented in reports. 
All these changes remain in the database until/unless you sort more data. In that case, the next report will redo the analysis, so you can start this joining work from the current group analysis. Alternatively, you can redo this analysis at any point, if you don't like the results of your groupings.
