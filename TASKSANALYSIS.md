# Analysis Tasks

## Running reports
Reports are listed under analytical tasks because they are a fundamental part of the analytical process, and have more to do with looking at data that is there, than with adding or modifying primary data. That said, you may be interested in running a report, even if you otherwise just do data collection.

## (Comprehensive) Alphabet Report
This report gives you information on Consonants and Vowels, according to the part of speech, syllable profile, and check you have asked for (e.g., CVCV Nouns by V1, or by V1=V2, or V1xV2 â€”the correspondence of the two vowels). The Comprehensive report gives you Nouns and Verbs, in the two largest syllable profiles, across all appropriate checks.

## (Comprehensive) Tone Report
This report gives you information on words in tone frames, according to the part of speech and syllable profile, organized with each framed example under its head word. The (by frames) report organizes the examples by frame, listing each word that has been sorted into that frame. The Comprehensive report gives you the top [two] parts of speech (should be Nouns and Verbs), in the [two] largest syllable profiles, across all appropriate checks (both of these numbers are configurable, if you want more (or less of either).
