# Starting from Scratch in WeSay for A→Z+T Work

- In the WeSay Config tool, click on `Get From Internet` (assuming you have your project ID from languagedepot by now), and fill out the form with the project ID, your username and password for languagedepot. These are **your** credentials; don't share them. I or anyone else who accesses your data via languagedepot should have their own.
- In the WeSay Config Tool settings window:
  - In the `Tasks` tab, select the box next to `SIL-CAWL Word List`.
  - In the `Input Systems` tab:
    - Confirm your gloss language is there (e.g., English), or define it (E.g., French or anything else).
    - Set up an IPA, or any other language writing systems you want (but A→Z+T will only be analyzing the orthographic writing system). Be sure to make them have different abbreviations, so you can tell them apart.
  - In the `Fields` tab:
    - Select the box next to `Citation Form`, and make sure your orthographic writing system is the only one selected.
    - If you want to collect words using **French**, remove English from the `Definition` field (at least until your word collection is done).
    - Select the box next to `Gloss`, and make sure the correct gloss language is selected (on the right).
  - In the `Interface Language` tab, set the WeSay's language, if you don't want it to talk to you in English.
  - In the `option lists` tab, if you want non-English part of speech labels, set them here. A→Z+T will use whatever labels you have in your data.
  - Click on `Open in WeSay`, in the upper right.
- In WeSay:
  - Go to the CAWL Word List tab, and fill out the 1700 word Comparative African Word List.
    - The list is on the left for you to browse if you like.
    - There is a (word) prompt and one field to fill in. This is where you put the orthographic form of the word in the language you are studying.
    - There are two buttons:
      - <enter> or <+>: give another word for the same prompt
      - <PageDown> or ->: go to next prompt.
  - We really should have part of speech confirmed here, though there isn't a great way to do that yet, except check each word one at a time. If you don't have good tests for your major grammatical categories (noun and verb), this can probably wait, without causing too much damage.
