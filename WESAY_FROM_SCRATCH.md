# Starting from Scratch in WeSay for A→Z+T Work

## Create Your WeSay Project
- Open WeSay, and you will see the `WeSay Config tool`, if you don't already have a WeSay project on your computer. If you do, you may need to find the WeSay Config tool by searching on your computer.
- click on `Get From Internet` (assuming you have your project ID from languagedepot by now), and fill out the form with the project ID, your username and password for languagedepot. These are **your** credentials; don't share them. I or anyone else who accesses your data via languagedepot should have their own.
- If you don't have your project ID from languagedepot yet, you can start a blank project, and add it to languagedepot later.

## Configure your WeSay Project
- Once you finish the above, the WeSay Config Tool will give you a settings window, for you to configure your WeSay project.
- In the `Tasks` tab, select the box next to `SIL-CAWL Word List`.
- In the `Input Systems` tab:
  - Confirm your gloss language is there (e.g., English), or define it (E.g., French or anything else).
  - If you want them, set up an IPA, or any other language writing systems (Note: A→Z+T will only be analyzing the orthographic writing system). Be sure to make them have different abbreviations, so you can tell them apart.
- In the `Fields` tab:
  - For each of these, select the field on the left, and select which langauge(s) it should use on the right.
  - Select the box next to `Citation Form`, and make sure your orthographic writing system is the only one selected.
  - If you want to collect words using **French**, remove English from the `Definition` field (at least until your word collection is done).
  - Select the box next to `Gloss`, and make sure the correct gloss language is selected.
- In the `Interface Language` tab, set WeSay's language, if you don't want it to talk to you in English.
- In the `option lists` tab, if you want non-English part of speech labels, set them here. A→Z+T will use whatever labels you have in your data.
- Click on `Open in WeSay`, in the upper right.

## Start Collecting Data In WeSay:

### Fill out the Comparative African Word List
- Go to the `CAWL Word List` tab, and fill out the 1700 word list.
  - The list is on the left for you to browse if you like.
  - There are three fields to the right of the list:
    - A prompt (word from the word list)
    - A place to type the word in the language you are studying, which means the same as the prompt word. Use the orthographic form.
    - A box which contains all the words already in the dictionary for that prompt (This will most often be empty, but if you have two words for 'body', for example, the first will show here while you type the second.)
  - There are two buttons:
    - <enter> or <+>: give another word for the same prompt
    - <PageDown> or ->: go to next prompt.

###Confirm Parts of Speech (Grammatical Categories)
- We really should confirm part of speech here, though there isn't a great way to do that yet, except check each word one at a time. If you don't have good tests for your major grammatical categories (noun and verb), and if you used the CAWL as above, this can probably wait, without causing too much damage (the CAWL gives part of speech designations, though they should be confirmed).
