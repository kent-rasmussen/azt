# Tone in Verb Roots

## Prerequisites
- [General workshop prerequisites](../WORKSHOPS.md#Prerequisites)
- Completed action items from previous workshops
- N.B.: in some contexts, it may make sense to do this workshop before Nouns.

## Goals
- Discuss possible tone frames for verbs, and set them up for testing
- Test frames on the whole process of sorting, on a small profile (~25 words)
- Record these words in all framed contexts

## Follow-up Action Items
- Sort the three largest syllable profiles for verbs in all frames
- Record all these words in all framed contexts
- Send your database to your consultant
