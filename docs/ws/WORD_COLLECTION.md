# Word Collection

## Prerequisites
[General workshop prerequisites](../WORKSHOPS.md#Prerequisites)

## Goals
- Install A-Z+T, and familiarize the team with the overall project, the A-Z+T interface, and the word collection task.
- Decide on citation forms for nouns and verbs.
- Get the team started on the basic task:
    *Add and Parse Words with Audio*, assuming there is a second form which is morphologically related to your citation form, which confirms part of speech (as noun or verb).
    *Add Words with Audio* can be used if there is no such second form. Please be sure to know somehow when you are dealing with a noun, and when you are dealing with a verb, and add the correct part of speech for each word.
    Tasks _without Audio_ are there in case your team has a serious problem recording, but should not normally be used. This will involve more typing (all characters) and you will need to record after the fact (with the *Record Words* task).
## Follow-up Action Items
- Finish collecting the Comparative African wordlist
- Send your database to your consultant.
