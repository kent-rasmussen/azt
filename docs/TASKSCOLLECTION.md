# Data Collection Tasks
If you want to run a report on any of the following (to see what you have done), those are described under [Analysis Tasks](TASKSANALYSIS.md).

## Add Words
This task looks a bit different, depending on what work has been done on your database.
If there are entries in your database that haven't been filled out yet, you will see an entry field here, where you can and type consonants and vowels appropriate for the word.

### Start work on a new language here
If you clicked on "Start work on a new language", either when A→Z+T opens, or after "Change to another database", this "Add Words" task is the first (and only, until you complete it) task you will see. A→Z+T will have already filled in entries with glosses, lexical category and CAWL tags, but no citation forms —this is what you will add in the field provided.

### Add remaining CAWL entries
This button is present if you are missing any of the 1700 tags of the Comparative African Word List (CAWL). If this is there, you typically want to start by pressing it (if you haven't already).
If you have entries with glosses corresponding to CAWL entries, but which aren't marked as CAWL entries, this button will also add those fields for you (rather than add entries with duplicate glosses).

### Add a Word
This button allows you to add one form and glosses for any word you like. It is only present after the CAWL is done.
You can fill out the Comparative African Word List (CAWL, the preferred method), or add words individually.
You can fill out the CAWL from a new database, or add blank entries for the CAWL to a database you have already started (though the "I haven't done the CAWL yet" button).

## Record Words
Once you have collected a word list, you can record those words here. These recordings become another form of the word (citation/plural/imperative) forms in your LIFT database.

## Sort Vowels
This tasks walks users through the sorting of words according to their vowels, one slice of data at a time, one vowel check at a time.

Where new vowels are found (or rather, an existing vowel is found to be more than one vowel), this process will result in new groups, but not change how the words are written. That is done in [the vowel letters analysis task](TASKSANALYSIS.md#transcribe-vowels).

## Sort Consonants
This tasks walks users through the sorting of words according to their consonants, one slice of data at a time, one vowel check at a time.

Where new consonants are found (or rather, an existing consonant is found to be more than one consonant), this process will result in new groups, but not change how the words are written. That is done in [the consonant letters analysis task](TASKSANALYSIS.md#transcribe-consonants).

## Sort Tone
This is this task where you will likely spend most of your time, sorting different words in different frames, asking which sound the same in a given context, and which sound different.

One of these frames is often isolation!

## Record Tone
Once you have sorted words by tone, you can record each of those words in each of those frames here. These recordings are stored in LIFT examples, not in word forms as above. Because of this, if you use an isolation frame, you may have isolation recordings in two places.
