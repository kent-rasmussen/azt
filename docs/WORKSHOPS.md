# Asset Based Language Development Workshops
This series of workshops is designed to facilitate motivated communities to develop their own orthographies, with minimal technical support from outside the community. These workshops will depend almost entirely on local funding and logistics; SIL will contribute linguistic expertise as needed, and provide evaluation and feedback to the communities.
For each workshop, SIL's commitment to helping a given community will depend on that community having fulfilled the prerequisites for that workshop. If the prerequisites are not fulfilled by the time a given workshop happens, that community would be welcome to join that workshop the next time it is offered —assuming they have the prerequisites done by then.
If you want any of these workshops in your home area, please consider inviting a neighboring language team to join you. You may want to consider sharing the burden of hosting between one workshop and another.

## Prerequisites
- Figure out workshop logistics for your team.
  - how to lodge your team
  - how to feed your team
  - how to get your team to and from the venue
  - how to pay for all of the above
  - If you want this in your home area, please consider inviting a neighboring language team to join you.
- Buy a computer, if you do not already have one.
- Get your computer set up with the SIL Cameroon keyboard (or a similar soft keyboard that will enable you to type all the characters you may need).
- Buy at least one flash drive dedicated to
  - backing up your data, and
  - sending your data to your consultant.
