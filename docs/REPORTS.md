# Running [A→Z+T] reports
Reports are a fundamental part of the analytical process, but can also be an encouragement in the data collection process, as it enables people to see what has been done so far.

Most of these reports run in the background, so you can ask for a report, then ask for another report (or go back to some other work) without waiting for the report to finish.

### Alphabet Reports
The most basic reports do just one check on a single slice of data (one lexical category and syllable profile). Users can set each of the following for a report:
- lexical category
- syllable profile
- type of check (vowels, consonants, vowel-consonant combinations, or consonant-vowel combinations)
- check to report on (e.g., V1, V1=V2, C2, etc)
[A→Z+T] will only offer you checks that make sense for your syllable profile, e.g., V1=V2 only appears if you have at least two vowels in the profile to be checked)

### Multislice Reports
Once you have done work on multiple slices of data, you may want to see them together in a report. These reports allow you to select the top syllable profile(s) in the top lexical categor(y/ies) with the number variable for each (leave at None to include all)

Setting the number of lexical categories at two (2) will almost always get you nouns and verbs.

### Multicheck Reports
Once you have checked Vowels or Consonants in multiple ways, you may want to see those results together. Multicheck reports run all of the checks available for one or more of the above check types, according to the user selection. This applies to consonants and vowels only; tone reports always run all checks (tone frames).

### Tone reports (incl. 'by location')
Tone reports always report each word (in the selected data slice(s)) in each location where it has been sorted. The default report presents this data with each location under one example for each word. The reports indicated 'by location' are organized the other way, with each word listed under one example for each location.

<!-- ### (Comprehensive) Alphabet Reports
This report gives you information on Consonants and Vowels. Because the comprehensive reports can be very comprehensive (they contain each check relevant to each syllable profile), there are four of them, to help you focus on what you're interested in:
- Comprehensive Vowel Report
- Comprehensive Consonant Report
- Comprehensive CxV Phonotactics Report
- Comprehensive Alphabet Report (all of the above) -->

<!-- ### (Comprehensive) Tone Report
This report gives you information on words in tone frames, according to the lexical category and syllable profile, organized with each framed example under its head word. The (by frames) report organizes the examples by frame, listing each word that has been sorted into that frame. The Comprehensive report gives you the top [two] lexical categories (should be Nouns and Verbs), in the [two] largest syllable profiles, across all appropriate checks (both of these numbers are configurable, if you want more or less of either). -->
