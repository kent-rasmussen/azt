# A→Z+T Menus

[A→Z+T] has by default **no menus**; if you see something you want to change (including the way the language name appears), click on it, and a dialog will appear for you to change it.

If you *need menus*, you can *show menus* through a context menu via right click anywhere in the main window –these menus allow you to change all these settings, and more.

The context menu also has a couple more options:

- If the 'click on what you want to change' interface really bothers you, and you want boxes around each thing that can be clicked on to change, select "Show Buttons"
- If the **font size** is too big for you (e.g., things are getting pushed off the screen),  you can select a theme with smaller fonts.
