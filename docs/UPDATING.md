# Updating [A→Z+T]

[A→Z+T] is in constant development, both in bug fixes and in new features. To take advantage of these fixes and features, you should make sure you are using the most recent published version.

To update [A→Z+T],
- First, make sure the [menus are shown](MENUS.md)
- Then select `Help`, then `Update [A→Z+T]`.
  - if you are in a workshop with me, or someone else who has updated [A→Z+T] source on a USB drive, and it is plugged it, it will pull from that.
- If [A→Z+T] is _already up to date_, a window will tell you so, and you can continue as normal.
- If [A→Z+T] loads _changes_, it will give you a brief overview (that you may not understand, don't worryǃ), and give you a button to **restart**.

## Updating when you have a problem
There is an update button on the error page, so you easily check for an update before restarting.

If you get stuck on the splash screen, click on the version number to update.

### If A→Z+T doesn't show you a user interface
Don't worry, you can still update easily, assuming you cloned [A→Z+T] when you installed (as recommended). In a terminal (in MS Windows, type in the search box: `cmd`):
- navigate to the azt tfolder (in MS Windows, copy/paste `cd /d %userprofile%/desktop/azt`)
- type `git pull`

If you didn't clone A→Z+T, you will need to download it again.
