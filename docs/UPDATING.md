# Updating [A→Z+T]

[A→Z+T] is in constant development, both in bug fixes and in new features. To take advantage of these fixes and features, you should make sure you are using the most recent published version.

To update [A→Z+T],
- First, make sure the [menus are shown](MENUS.md)
- Then select `Help`, then `Update [A→Z+T] (Internet)` or `Update [A→Z+T] (USB)`, as appropriate.
  - N.B., the _USB_ option is only useful if you are in a workshop with me, or someone else who has updated [A→Z+T] source on a USB drive.
- If [A→Z+T] is _already up to date_, a window will tell you so, and you can continue as normal.
- If [A→Z+T] loads _changes_, it will give you a brief overview (that you may not understand, don't worryǃ), and give you a button to **restart**.
