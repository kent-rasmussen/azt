# Testing [A-Z+T]

If you've asked for a feature or bug fix, I may ask you to try out the testing branch of [A-Z+T]. Or, you may want to do this if you just want to see what's coming next.

To switch between main and testing versions,
- First, make sure the [menus are shown](MENUS.md)
- Then select `Help`, then `Try [A-Z+T] test version` or `Revert to [A-Z+T] main version`, as appropriate.
- [A-Z+T] will automatically:
  - [update](UPDATING.md) [A-Z+T]
  - switch versions
  - restart
