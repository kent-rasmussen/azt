# Collaboration and Data Backup

As described in the [usage page](USAGE.md#collaboration-and-archival), being able to store and share data is critical to any serious research project. This page orients you to the way [A→Z+T] can help you do that.

## Normal usage
Each time [A→Z+T] opens and closes, it attempts to store changes in a repository (the folder with your [LIFT] file), as well as send and receive between that repository and one or more on attached media (USB drives).

If it finds a drive with a repository it has shared with before, it will do that send/receive out of view of the user.

## Reminders
If the project has been used with a USB backup in the past, but none are connected when looked for, then [A→Z+T] notifies the user once per attempted send/receive.

If the project has never been used with USB backup before, the user will get just one message, on startup, each time [A→Z+T] boots. I trust that minimal engagement will not be burdensome for those who have decided against backing up their data, for whatever reason.

## Copy to a USB drive
Any time [A→Z+T] doesn't find a USB drive attached, the message window contains a button allowing the user to copy their data repository to a new USB drive. Click the button, then tell [A→Z+T] where to put the new repository folder copy (e.g., select a USB drive).
