# Bugs
If you run AZT and it crashes, please [find an error log](FINDERRORLOGS.md) and send it to me at kent_rasmussen@sil.org, along with a brief description of what you were doing, and what you saw A→Z+T doing, just before the crash. I will do what I can to fix the problem that caused the crash, and get back to you on how you can move forward.

There will of course be problems with this program, as with any set of instructions which seeks, in advance, to account for situations that occur later, and sometimes in an unpredictable manner.

If you get unexpected behavior out of AZT, please understand that it may or may not be a bug. In either case, please feel free to write me with a description of what happened, and how it differed from your expectations. Please also include the run log (`log_<date>.txt`) from the run where this behavior happened, and maybe append something meaningful to the filename. Note that this file is overwritten each time you start A→Z+T, so renaming it immediately will preserve that file to send me later, if you like. But more critically, at any one time it only contains the run log of the _latest_ run, so you can't use it to send me information on a previous run.

A→Z+T is heavily in development, and I'm looking for feedback. The fact that something is the way it is by design today doesn't mean that it must stay that way —though please understand I want this tool to be of the broadest use possible, so I will not prioritize idiosyncratic use cases without reason.
