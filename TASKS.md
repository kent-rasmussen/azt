# Ordered Task List
Aâ†’Z+T is now organized into a series of discrete tasks, which are divided into the following two groups:, on those where it is being manipulated, processed, or in some other way analyzed.

## [Data Collection Tasks](TASKSCOLLECTION.md)

In [these tasks](TASKSCOLLECTION.md), language data is being collected. These should only be done by competent speakers of the language being of study. These may or may not have much linguistic training; the important point of these tasks is that good data be collected well.

This currently includes collecting words, and sorting them into groups that sound the same in various contexts, and recording those words in those contexts. For more information on specific data collection tasks, see [this page](TASKSCOLLECTION.md).

## [Analysis Tasks](TASKSANALYSIS.md)

In [these tasks](TASKSANALYSIS.md), language data is being processed in some way. These typically should be done by someone with at least some linguistics training, though not necessarily a speaker of the language.

These tasks currently include transcribing surface tone groups in a meaningful way (hopefully phonetically), running reports that correlate the various surface forms, and grouping those hypersplit underlying form drafts into more meaningful and more appropriately split groups. For more information on specific analysis tasks, see [this page](TASKSANALYSIS.md).
