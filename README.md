# A→Z+T

This is a dictionary and orthography checker, with initial focus on data collection for tonal languages. It is designed to *supplement* (not replace) formal training, on the one hand, and *facilitate* a particular kind of language development on the other, so it may not do what you want —it certainly does not do everything. If you want to get as many people involved in the development of their own language as possible, in a manner that results in a checked lexical database backed up by sound files, then this tool is for you.
## Why
