# Practical prerequisites
In case it isn't obvious, in order to use this program to actually do anything, one needs a LIFT database to check. Fortunately these are not hard to generate; LIFT is an open XML specification for storing lexical data. You can create a LIFT database by
- collecting words in WeSay ([https://software.sil.org/wesay/],[https://software.sil.org/wesay/download/])
  - while you're installing things, I highly recommend the excellent library of images that works with WeSay, the Art of Reading ([https://bloomlibrary.org/artofreading])
- building a dictionary in FLEx, and exporting to LIFT/WeSay.
To use Aâ†’Z+T, the first time you run the program, you will need to select your LIFT database. results will be stored in that directory.
