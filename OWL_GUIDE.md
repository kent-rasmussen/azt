# Orientation to A→Z+T for the Ordinary Working Linguist

## Or, how to think about A→Z+T, if you're used to FLEx (or WeSay).

Perhaps the first and most important thing to realize is that **[A→Z+T](https://github.com/kent-rasmussen/azt) is not designed to replace FLEx**. It has a different audience and different functions, and this is by design. So if [FLEx](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/) does everything you want to do, then you will probably be happier just sticking with it.

Most of the same could be said of [WeSay](https://software.sil.org/wesay/), though the audiences would be more similar.

## Functions

### Individual v Grouped Entries/senses
In terms of functions, both [A→Z+T](https://github.com/kent-rasmussen/azt) and FLEx (or WeSay) could be conceived of as dictionary builders. But FLEx (and typically WeSay) build data one entry at a time, once sense at a time. If there is a problem with data, you go in to that one entry/sense, and find the field with bad data, and change it.

A→Z+T, on the other hand, treats data in relevant groups. If a number of words sort together, and there is a problem with them, it is fixed once for the group, rather than in each entry/sense. Words can be sorted in and out of groups, but there is no way to change the data on an individual word/entry/sense.

So, if you are a person who likes to check data word by word, you will probably be happier with FLEX or WeSay. But if checking words in groups makes more sense to you, you may be happier with A→Z+T.

## Audiences

### Field dependency, High/low Context
Some people like to see things in context, in order to understand them better, and to know how to fix them. Others are happier with lots of abstract options to pick from at any given moment. Neither of these are better; this is a difference reflected across cultures and personalities.

FLEx is designed for people who are comfortable with computers, and provides options to filter and sort data in almost any way you can imagine. **If you like spreadsheets, you probably like FLEx.**

A→Z+T, on the other hand, is designed for people who want to do a specific set of things, perhaps in a specific order, without needing a lot of options. On most pages, the user clicks one button at a time. Or, if there is a field to fill in (like for the word list collection), there is one field presented at a time. A→Z+T specifically avoids offering a user the chance to put good data in the wrong place. So **if you've ever been confused, frustrated or lost using a spreadsheet, you may enjoy using A→Z+T.**
