# Orientation to A→Z+T for the Orinary Working Linguist

## Or, how to think about A→Z+T, if you're used to FLEx (or WeSay).

Perhaps the first and most important thing to realize is that A→Z+T is not designed to replace FLEx. It has a different audience, and different functions, and this is by design. So if FLEx does everything you want to do, then you will probably be happier just sticking with it.

Most of the same could be said of WeSay, though the audiences would be more similar.
