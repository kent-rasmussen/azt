<!-- a set of glossaryTerms
       The label attribute is a way to have the title be something other than the default "glossary Terms" 
       The version attribute is a way to document the set of glossaryTerms contained within this element. 
       This is to facilitate reuse of sets of glossaryTerms.
       This is a subcomponent of XLingPap
       The usesmallcaps attribute is deprecated; use font-variant='small-caps' or, better, use a real small caps font-family

<!-- a glossary term that might be used within a document.
A given glossary term may be expressed in more than one language (e.g. English, Spanish, French, etc.).  Thus it has multiple glossaryTermInLang elements.
It only shows if there is an instance of a referring glossaryTermRef element in the document;
   the id attribute uniquely identifies this glossaryTerm so it can be referred to by glossaryTermRef elements
