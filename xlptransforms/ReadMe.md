I have furthermore clarified with the author that I have permission to modify and redistribute this material with this larger repository.

Modifications I have made so far are limited to implementing the exslt.org nodeset function, by
- Adding `xmlns:exsl="http://exslt.org/common"` to the opening declaration
- Converting XSLT 1.0 result tree fragments like
      - select="$childDoc/root/node()"
to node sets like
      - select="exsl:node-set($childDoc)/root/node()"

Search for (\$[^],/=") []+)([/[]+)
replace with exsl:node-set(\1)\2
inside normalize-space() is OK
There were a few cases requiring more manual workâ€¦ but mostly incorporated
