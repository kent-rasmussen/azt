# Prerequisites for Consultancy Help

I want to help as many people as I can get the most out of A→Z+T, and move forward the collection and analysis of consonant, vowel and tone data across Africa. To facilitate this goal, if you want help from me, I have drawn up a list of things you should do, below. These are not required to work with A→Z+T; you can do all kinds of work with A→Z+T under different terms, and I hope you do, if that's what you want. But I must keep my work organized, or I will have to help fewer people. So, if you take this list seriously, it will help me take you seriously. So here goes:

## Get set up on languagedepot.org
  - **do this first**, as it may take awhile to finish
  - You will need an account (username and password) for yourself first, which you can sign up for [here](http://public.languagedepot.org/account/register).
  - Once you have an account, sign in, and you will see instructions on the main page to ask for an repository for your language data. Basically, you will write an Email to admin@languagedepot.org, requesting an account with five lines of information. You want a **Dictionary** repository to work with A→Z+T; everything else should be straightforward.
  - **Wait** for a response from admin@languagedepot.org, which will give you your project id. It should be something like `<ethnologue_code>-dictionary`. If it isn't, please [forward the Email to me](<mailto:kent_rasmussen@sil.org?subject=Languagedepot-A→Z+T problem>) and I'll advise you how to proceed.
  - While you wait, install [Mercurial (Hg)](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Download) so A→Z+T can make changes to your repository for you.

## Prepare your LIFT database
  - If **you have a database but not in LIFT** (i.e., in FLEx, or a spreadsheet, or an electronic or paper document), then you must get help converting it. Some conversions are easier than other (e.g., from FLEx); others are very difficult (e.g., typing from a handwritten notebook).
  - If **you don't already have a database**, and don't already use FLEx, download WeSay and follow [the WeSay from Scratch directions](WESAY_FROM_SCRATCH.md) to set up your project in WeSay set up your project there.
  - Take a look at the [practical prerequisites](USAGE.md#practical-prerequisites) for your database, and see that yours has what it needs.
    - If you followed the `WeSay from Scratch` directions above, you should be OK.

## Install A→Z+T
- Simple instructions are [here](SIMPLEINSTALL.md); please work all the way down this page, and do everything on it. Don't stop unless you really can't continue. If you get stuck, please [Email me](<mailto:kent_rasmussen@sil.org?subject=Please help with A→Z+T Installation>) with specific questions or problems.

## Field Work: Develop draft tone frames
- See [Tone Frame Design](USAGE.md#tone-frame-design) for a description of this task.
- Work with one speaker, as this can be a lot of work, and doesn't typically require group discussion.
- You want at least four frames, such that
  - Each frame gives a different tonal melody than the other frames:
    - High tone before the word
    - High tone after the word
    - Low tone before the word
    - Low tone after the word
  - each frame can be used with almost all words in the class for which they were designed (i.e., noun or verb).
- This may take several hours, or longer.
- If you don't already understand what this entails, you will need help from a linguist near you.

## Define Your Tone Frames in A→Z+T
- Instructions are [here](USAGE.md#tone-frames).
- Do more extensive testing of your tone frames, again with one speaker.
  - You can test a frame with more words, more quickly, by doing some sorting in A→Z+T.
  - confirm that word-frame combinations look OK, and
  - confirm that most words work in each of the frames. If a frame has many words that don't work in it, you should probably replace it.

## Collect data in A→Z+T
- **Organize a meeting** of more (3+) speakers, for them to sort and record data together in A→Z+T. You can organize this as you like, but expect at **least two weeks** of full time work for everyone.
- At the meeting:
  - **Sort** data in A→Z+T, start with:
    - largest 2-3 syllable profiles for Nouns in each of four **tonally different** frames
    - largest 2-3 syllable profiles for Verbs in each of four **tonally different** frames
    - **Tonally different**: if you don't know what this means, plan on getting help from a linguist near you, or sorting on at least eight frames (Once you have sorted on these, I can look through them for you, and tell you which are tonally different, and what you are missing).
    - There is a lot more sorting you can do, but this should be the right place to start, and will be a good beginning to understand your tone system.
  - **Record** all sorted data in A→Z+T
  - **Record** citation forms for at least the above (largest 2-3 syllable profiles for Nouns and Verbs)

## Collaborate and Get Help
- Once you have data you want feedback on, give me permission to read your languagedepot.org repository (Settings/Members/New Member), and [send me your questions](<mailto:kent_rasmussen@sil.org?subject=Please%20help%20with%20A→Z+T>)!
