# Prerequisites for Consultancy Help

I want to help as many people as I can get the most out of A→Z+T, and move forward the collection and analysis of consonant, vowel and tone data across Africa. To facilitate this goal, if you want help from me, I have drawn up a list of things you should do, below. These are not required to work with A→Z+T; you can do all kinds of work with A→Z+T under different terms, and I hope you do, if that's what you want. But I must keep my work organized, or I will have to help fewer people. So, if you take this list seriously, it will help me take you seriously. So here goes:

- Get set up on languagedepot.org (do this first, as it may take awhile to finish):
  - You will need an account (username and password) for yourself first, which you can sign up for [here](http://public.languagedepot.org/account/register).
  - Once you have an account, sign in, and you will see instructions on the main page to ask for an repository for your language data. Basically, you will write an Email to admin@languagedepot.org, requesting an account with five lines of information. You want a **Dictionary** repository to work with A→Z+T; everything else should be straightforward.
  - Wait for a response from admin@languagedepot.org, which will give you your project id. It should be something like `<ethnologue_code>-dictionary`. If it isn't, please forward the Email to me and I'll advise you how to proceed.
- If you don't already have a database in LIFT format, set that up.
  - If you have a database but not in LIFT (i.e., in FLEx, or a spreadsheet, or an electronic or paper document), then you must get help converting it. Some conversions are easier than other (e.g., from FLEx); others are very difficult (typing from a handwritten notebook).
  - If you don't already have a database, and don't already use FLEx, download WeSay and set up your project there:
    - In the WeSay Config tool, click on `Get From Internet` (assuming you have your project ID from languagedepot by now), and fill out the form with the project ID, your username and password for languagedepot. These are **your** credentials; don't share them. I or anyone else who accesses your data via languagedepot should have their own.
    - In the WeSay Config Tool settings window:
      - In the `Tasks` tab, select the box next to `SIL-CAWL Word List`.
      - In the `Input Systems` tab:
        - Confirm your gloss language is there (e.g., English), or define it (E.g., French or anything else).
        - Set up an IPA, or any other language writing systems you want (but A→Z+T will only be analyzing the orthographic writing system). Be sure to make them have different abbreviations, so you can tell them apart.
      - In the `Fields` tab:
        - Select the box next to `Citation Form`, and make sure your orthographic writing system is the only one selected.
        - If you want to collect words using **French**, remove English from the `Definition` field (at least until your word collection is done).
        - Select the box next to `Gloss`, and make sure the correct gloss language is selected (on the right).
      - In the `Interface Language` tab, set the WeSay's language, if you don't want it to talk to you in English.
      - In the `option lists` tab, if you want non-English part of speech labels, set them here. A→Z+T will use whatever labels you have in your data.
      - Click on `Open in WeSay`, in the upper right.
    - In WeSay:
      - Go to the CAWL Word List tab, and fill out the 1700 word Comparative African Word List.
        - The list is on the left for you to browse if you like.
        - There is a (word) prompt and one field to fill in. This is where you put the orthographic form of the word in the language you are studying.
        - There are two buttons:
          - <enter> or <+>: give another word for the same prompt
          - <PageDown> or ->: go to next prompt.
      - We really should have part of speech confirmed here, though there isn't a great way to do that yet, except check each word one at a time. If you don't have good tests for your major grammatical categories (noun and verb), this can probably wait, without causing too much damage.
  - Take a look at the [practical prerequisites](USAGE.md#practical-prerequisites) for your database, and see that yours has what it needs.
    - If you followed `you don't already have a database` above, you should be OK.
- Follow the instructions [here](SIMPLEINSTALL.md) to install A→Z+T. Please work all the way down this page, and do everything on it. Don't stop unless you really can't continue. If you get stuck, please Email me with specific questions or problems.
- Develop draft tone frames (see [Tone Frame Design](USAGE.md#tone-frame-design)) with one speaker, and test that they are helpful. This may take several hours, or longer. If you don't already understand what this entails, you will need help from a linguist.
- Define those tone frames in A→Z+T, as [here](USAGE.md#tone-frames).
- Test your tone frames (again with one speaker), that they are working correctly. To do this, you will need to do some sorting in A→Z+T, and confirm that word-frame combinations look OK, and that most words work in each of the frames. If a frame has many words that don't work in it, you should probably replace it.
- Organize a meeting of more (3+) speakers, for them to sort data together in A→Z+T.
- At the meeting:
  - Sort data in A→Z+T, start with:
    - top 2-3 syllable profiles for Nouns
    - top 2-3 syllable profiles for Verbs
  - Record all sorted data in A→Z+T
  - Record citation forms at least for the above groups
- Once you have data you want feedback on, give me permission to read your languagedepot.org repository (Settings/Members/New Member), and [send me your questions](mailto:kent_rasmussen@sil.org?subject=Please help with A→Z+T installation)!
