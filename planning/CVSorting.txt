â—» *CV sorting notes* - Set up groups in advance, based on orthography
Need to meaningfully name groups upfront? No, just give variable when removing from a group, like _, or VC, or { }...
When confirming verification of a group, ask user what symbol to use for that group.
Maybe force check on not using symbols already in use, or maybe allow joining with another group by using the same symbol (as is currently possible for tone)
When user gives form, replace only form with new form, for lc, lx, pl, and imp --same find replace for each.
In any case, probably should back up original pre-check form in another field (just another writing system, in a comment, or elsewhere?)
Not likely in examples...
