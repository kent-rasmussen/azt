# Data Collection Tasks
If you want to run a report on any of the following (to see what you have done), those are described under [Analysis Tasks](TASKSANALYSIS.md).

## Add Words
You can fill out the Comparative African Word List (CAWL, the preferred method), or add words individually.
You can fill out the CAWL from a new database, or add blank entries for the CAWL to a database you have already started.

## Recording Words 
Once you have collected a word list, you can record those words here. These recordings become another form of the word (citation/plural/imperative) forms in your LIFT database.

## Sort Tone
This is this task where you will likely spend most of your time, sorting different words in different frames, asking which sound the same in a given context, and which sound different.
One of these frames is often isolation!

## Record Tone
Once you have sorted words by tone, you can record each of those words in each of those frames here. These recordings are stored in LIFT examples, not in word forms as above. Because of this, if you use an isolation frame, you may have isolation recordings in two places.
